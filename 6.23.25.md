## Networking Concepts Learned

### IPv4 Subnetting & VLSM Breakthrough
- **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masks)**: Allows network administrators to create different sized subnets within the same classful network
- **Key Insight**: The IP address with VLSM notation (e.g., 203.45.67.64/26) gives you the **starting point** of the range
- **Example Understanding**:
  - 203.45.67.0/26 = Range: .0 to .63 (64 addresses)
  - 203.45.67.64/26 = Range: .64 to .127 (64 addresses)
  - 203.45.67.128/25 = Range: .128 to .255 (128 addresses)

### Network vs Host Portions
- **Network bits**: Tell us which network we're referring to (like a ZIP code)
- **Host bits**: Identify specific devices on that network (like house numbers)
- **Subnet mask**: Defines where network portion ends and host portion begins
- **Lab network**: 10.0.0.0/24 = first 24 bits for network, last 8 bits for hosts

### DNS (Domain Name System) Deep Dive
- **DNS**: Translates human-readable names to IP addresses that computers use
- **DNS Zone**: Container/filing cabinet for all DNS records of a specific domain
- **A Record**: Maps domain name to IPv4 address (like phone book entry)
- **Example**: corp.project-x-dc.com A record = 10.0.0.5

### Active Directory Integration
- **Multiple functions**: User authentication, DNS server, DHCP, Group Policy
- **Domain Controller**: Central server managing all AD services
- **DNS dependency**: AD requires proper DNS configuration to function

## VM Lab Environment Setup

### Architecture Built
- **Domain Controller (Windows Server 2025)**: corp.project-x-dc.com
- **Linux Workstation**: For penetration testing scenarios
- **Network**: 10.0.0.0/24 subnet in VirtualBox

### Technologies Implemented
- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS Server role
- Network intrusion testing environment
- Cross-platform domain integration

## Troubleshooting Session

### Problem 1: VM Internet Connectivity
**Symptoms**: 
- VMs couldn't connect to internet
- Linux workstation couldn't communicate with domain controller

**Root Cause**: Missing web server role in Active Directory installation

**Solution**: 
- Installed web server role in AD
- Enabled proper service communication

### Problem 2: DNS Resolution Failure
**Symptoms**: 
```
nslookup corp.project-x-dc.com
Server: Unknown
Address: 10.0.0.5
*** Unknown can't find corp.project-x-dc.com: No response from server
```

**Root Cause**: DNS client not pointing to correct DNS server

**Solution**: 
```powershell
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddress 10.0.0.5
```

### Problem 3: IP Address Mismatch
**Symptoms**: 
- nslookup returned 10.0.2.5
- ping replied from 10.0.0.5
- Inconsistent network communication

**Root Cause**: DNS A record pointing to wrong IP address

**Diagnosis Process**:
1. Identified server actual IP: 10.0.0.5
2. Found DNS A record pointing to: 10.0.2.5
3. Used DNS Manager to correct A record

**Solution**: Updated DNS A record from 10.0.2.5 to 10.0.0.5

### Problem 4: Browser Internet Access
**Symptoms**: 
- PowerShell ping to google.com worked
- Test-NetConnection to ports 80/443 failed
- Web browser couldn't access internet

**Root Cause**: VirtualBox network configuration mismatch

**Diagnosis**: NAT Network configured for 10.0.2.0/24 but VMs using 10.0.0.0/24

**Solution**: Changed VirtualBox NAT Network IPv4 prefix from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.0.0/24

## Advanced Cybersecurity Insight

### Threat Modeling Exercise
**Spontaneous attack scenario developed**:
1. **Initial Access**: Phishing email compromise
2. **Lateral Movement**: Network reconnaissance and expansion
3. **Persistence**: Keylogger installation for credential harvesting
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Admin credential capture
5. **DNS Poisoning**: Modify A records to redirect traffic
6. **Man-in-the-Middle**: Collect credentials from fake login pages
7. **Data Exfiltration**: Mass credential theft with password reuse implications

**Key Realization**: Attack methodology flows naturally from understanding network infrastructure and trust relationships.

## Technical Commands Used

### DNS Troubleshooting
```powershell
Get-ADDomainController
Get-DnsServerZone
Get-DnsClientServerAddress
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddress 10.0.0.5
nslookup corp.project-x-dc.com
ping corp.project-x-dc.com
```

### Network Connectivity Testing
```powershell
Test-NetConnection google.com -Port 80
Test-NetConnection google.com -Port 443
ipconfig /flushdns
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

### DNS Record Management
```powershell
Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName "corp.project-x-dc.com" -RRType A
```
