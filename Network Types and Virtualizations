## Detailed Technology Explanations

### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
- **Purpose:** Allow multiple private devices to share one public IP address
- **How it works:** Router translates internal IPs (192.168.1.x) to external public IP
- **Problem solved:** IPv4 address exhaustion - billions of devices, limited public IPs
- **Example:** Your home router allowing all devices to access internet through one ISP connection
- **Types:**
  - **Static NAT:** 1:1 mapping (one private IP = one public IP)
  - **Dynamic NAT:** Pool of public IPs assigned as needed
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation):** Many private IPs = one public IP + different ports

### **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

#### **Site-to-Site VPN**
- **Purpose:** Connect entire networks securely over internet
- **Example:** Company headquarters ↔ branch office
- **Benefit:** Encrypted tunnel between locations

#### **Client VPN (Remote Access)**
- **Purpose:** Individual device connects to corporate network
- **Example:** Employee laptop → company network from home
- **Protocols:** OpenVPN, IPSec, WireGuard

#### **Mesh VPN**
- **Purpose:** Every device connects to every other device
- **Example:** Tailscale, ZeroTier
- **Benefit:** No central server bottleneck

### **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**
- **Purpose:** Logically separate traffic on same physical switch
- **Layer:** 2 (Data Link - Ethernet level)
- **Example:** 
  - VLAN 10: Employee computers
  - VLAN 20: Guest WiFi
  - VLAN 30: Servers
- **Benefit:** Security isolation without separate physical networks
- **How it works:** IEEE 802.1Q tags added to Ethernet frames

### **VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)**
- **Purpose:** Extend Layer 2 networks across Layer 3 (IP) boundaries
- **Problem solved:** VLAN scalability (limited to 4,096 VLANs)
- **How it works:** Ethernet frames encapsulated in UDP packets
- **Example:** VM migration between data centers while keeping same MAC/IP
- **Use case:** Multi-tenant cloud environments
- **Scale:** Supports 16 million virtual networks vs 4,096 VLANs

### **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)**
- **Purpose:** Tunnel any protocol through IP networks
- **How it works:** Wraps original packet in new IP header
- **Example:** Connect sites using legacy protocols over modern IP network
- **Note:** No encryption by default (often combined with IPSec)
- **Use case:** Simple point-to-point tunnels

### **MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)**
- **Purpose:** Fast packet forwarding using labels instead of complex IP lookups
- **How it works:** Packets get labels, routers forward based on labels
- **Benefits:**
  - **Performance:** Faster than IP routing
  - **QoS:** Quality of Service guarantees
  - **Traffic Engineering:** Control path selection
- **Use case:** ISP backbones, enterprise WANs
- **Downside:** Expensive, proprietary

### **SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN)**
- **Purpose:** Centrally managed, policy-driven wide area networking
- **How it works:** Software overlay on multiple internet connections
- **Benefits:**
  - **Cost:** Replace expensive MPLS with internet + intelligence
  - **Agility:** Centralized policy management
  - **Performance:** Automatic failover and load balancing
- **Example:** Branch offices with multiple ISPs + automatic path selection
- **Vendors:** Cisco, VMware, Silver Peak, Fortinet

## Network Concepts

### **Overlay Network**
- **Definition:** Virtual network built on top of physical network
- **Examples:** VXLAN, Tailscale, Docker networks
- **Benefit:** Logical separation without physical changes

### **Underlay Network**
- **Definition:** The physical network infrastructure underneath
- **Components:** Switches, routers, cables, fiber
- **Relationship:** Overlay networks depend on reliable underlay
